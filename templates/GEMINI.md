# Antigravity Orchestrator Instructions

For complex coding tasks, use the `agy-orchestrator` skill when its trigger conditions match.

The root agent owns architecture, decomposition, integration, and final verification.
Prefer specialized subagents for bounded exploration, implementation, testing, review, and technical research using `invoke_subagent`.

Do not delegate trivial work merely for parallelism.
Do not let multiple implementation agents edit the same files without explicit ownership boundaries or workspace isolation.
User instructions always take precedence over this orchestration policy.
